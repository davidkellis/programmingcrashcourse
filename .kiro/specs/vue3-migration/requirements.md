# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature migrates the existing React-based Interactive Programming Tutorial to Vue 3 while eliminating the backend dependency and creating a fully client-side application. The migration will preserve all current functionality, visual styling, and behavior using static content and in-browser code execution. The system will maintain the same user experience, including the integrated REPL and interactive code execution capabilities, while simplifying the architecture by removing server-side components. Additionally, the language selector feature that appears to be missing from the current implementation will be restored and enhanced to ensure users can easily switch between programming languages.

3. WHEN code executes THEN the system SHALL display results in the REPL output area with the same formatting as the React version
4. WHEN I type code directly in the REPL THEN the system SHALL execute it using the in-browser language runtimes (Pyodide, native JS, ruby.wasm)
5. WHEN switching between tutorial sections THEN the system SHALL maintain REPL session state and execution history

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a learner, I want the same tutorial content display and navigation so that my learning experience remains consistent after the migration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing tutorial sections THEN the system SHALL render markdown content with identical formatting to the React version
2. WHEN viewing code snippets THEN the system SHALL apply syntax highlighting using the same color scheme and styling
3. WHEN navigating between sections THEN the system SHALL provide the same navigation controls and behavior
4. WHEN viewing the tutorial layout THEN the system SHALL maintain the same responsive design and component positioning

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Vue migration to use modern Vue 3 patterns and best practices so that the codebase is maintainable and follows current standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing components THEN the system SHALL use Vue 3 Composition API with `<script setup>` syntax
2. WHEN managing state THEN the system SHALL use Vue 3 reactive state management patterns
3. WHEN handling routing THEN the system SHALL use Vue Router 4 with the same route structure as the React version
4. WHEN implementing TypeScript THEN the system SHALL maintain full type safety equivalent to the React implementation
5. WHEN building the application THEN the system SHALL use Vite as the build tool with Vue 3 optimizations

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the migration to eliminate backend dependencies and create a fully client-side application so that deployment and maintenance are simplified while preserving all functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading tutorial content THEN the system SHALL serve static content files without requiring a backend API
2. WHEN executing code THEN the system SHALL use only in-browser runtime services (Pyodide, ruby.wasm, native JS) without server-side execution
3. WHEN managing user sessions THEN the system SHALL use browser localStorage and sessionStorage for all persistence needs
4. WHEN handling errors THEN the system SHALL provide client-side error handling and user feedback mechanisms
5. WHEN deploying the application THEN the system SHALL be deployable as static files to any web server or CDN

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing for the Vue migration so that I can ensure feature parity and prevent regressions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL include unit tests for all Vue components equivalent to the React tests
2. WHEN testing interactions THEN the system SHALL verify that all user interactions work identically to the React version
3. WHEN testing integrations THEN the system SHALL ensure REPL functionality and API communication work correctly
4. WHEN performing visual testing THEN the system SHALL confirm that styling and layout match the React implementation

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want the language selector to be more prominent and user-friendly than in the previous implementation so that I can easily discover and use this important feature.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the application header THEN the system SHALL display the language selector with clear labeling and visual prominence
2. WHEN the language selector is inactive THEN the system SHALL show a clear placeholder indicating language selection is available
3. WHEN hovering over the language selector THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback to indicate it's interactive
4. WHEN no language is selected THEN the system SHALL default to Python and clearly indicate the current selection
5. WHEN displaying language options THEN the system SHALL show language names with recognizable icons or indicators

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a learner, I want the REPL to be dockable and resizable without interfering with the tutorial content so that I can customize my learning environment while maintaining full access to the teaching material.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the tutorial THEN the system SHALL dock the REPL panel to either the bottom or right side of the page without floating over content
2. WHEN the REPL is docked to the bottom THEN the system SHALL allow vertical resizing of the REPL panel height
3. WHEN the REPL is docked to the right THEN the system SHALL allow horizontal resizing of the REPL panel width
4. WHEN resizing the REPL THEN the system SHALL automatically adjust the tutorial content area to use the remaining available space
5. WHEN the REPL position changes THEN the system SHALL persist the user's preferred docking position and size across sessions

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a learner, I want the tutorial content to utilize the full available screen space so that I can read the teaching material comfortably without unnecessary whitespace or layout constraints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing tutorial content THEN the system SHALL use the full width of the available content area
2. WHEN the REPL is hidden THEN the system SHALL expand the content area to use the entire page width
3. WHEN the REPL is docked THEN the system SHALL adjust the content area to use all remaining space after accounting for the REPL panel
